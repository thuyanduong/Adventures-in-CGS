## Some Much Needed Context

* My friend and I built this game as part of our High School honors program capstone project.
If you were a student in this honors program, for your senior year, you worked on a year long academic
capstone project of your choice.

* CGS was the name of this honors program. Hence, the game is called "Adventures in CGS".
We were the stereotypical 'nerds' of the school. But that's OK because we got to go on various academic retreats that other student didn't get to go on!

* These retreats included trips to the James River to sample the water quality, Shakespearian theater,
navigating through the woods using only a compass, or camping trips just for fun!

* The game was inspired by Nintendo's "Mario", an adventure game where you bypass or defeat enemies to get to the goal line.

* There are four levels. Each level takes place at one of our past retreats, and each
level features a new category of enemies -- other high school stereotype: jocks/cheerleaders, goth kids, country boys/gals, and JROTC kids.
